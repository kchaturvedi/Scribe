Hi Friend ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for stopping by! Welcome to Scribe, the markdown serverless blogging framework.

Here is a brief tutorial to get started. Feel free to have a look around and experiment with the files yourself, and [let me know](mailto:kartik@ikartik.com) if you have any questions or feature suggestions!

### Features
Scribe is built to be different than most other blogging platforms. Let's go over the main ones now.

**Markdown**
Yes, Scribe is Markdown-based. 100% (yes, this page too!). No HTML / JavaScript / CSS required. You can add images, links, tables, and style your text however you like.

Of course, you can easily embed HTML into any Markdown post if you need to. ðŸ˜‰

**Next.js + React**
Blogs can be quite large sometimes, and that is what makes them slow.
But not Scribe â€” because it is built with React for snappy performance and Next.js for server-side rendering, which means only the content you want is downloaded to your device. Faster performance, less loading, more reading. ðŸ™Œ

**Serverless Deployments**
Instead of paying a monthly fee to host your blog, only pay for when someone actually visits your blog. With serverless deployments, your blog posts, images, videos, and everything else just sit in the cloud and do nothing. When someone visits your blog, the server quickly wakes up and servers the reader with your content, before sleeping again. Cheap and still blazing fast!

### Coming soon!
More features are on the way, such as support for **device dark modes** ðŸŒ’ and **CMS support** so edits show up instantly without the need to redeploy. Stay tuned!
