# Like Night and Day
Edition 8 | 11 March, 2018

As you may know, not all ideas can be conveyed through written words because gestures, emotion, facial expressions are also part of the language toolkit we humans have developed to communicate with each other. These tools are lost in writing, but our technology today has made them more accessible than ever. Therefore, I am going to periodically send editions that center around a short video or song, along with a shorter article. These more engaging mediums will help better convey the ideas and thoughts of this newsletter in a way my writing alone could not. Let me know what you think of this format, or anything else, by emailing me at kartik@ikartik.com or by just hitting reply.

We have talked about the importance of language before in this newsletter, and this week we will see it in *Khamakha* (“randomly”), a beautiful Hindi short film that weaves together the paths of two travellers that have nothing in common. The story of how one of them opens up a whole new world for the other is something I do not want to spoil for you, so watch it for yourself:

Udayan and Raina both have many differences in their behaviour, personality, and culture. But the major difference is language – while Raina knows multiple languages, Udayan is isolated in one particular, seemingly “modern” environment. In a world where “modern” means more attention, the film actually shows him to have a narrower, more ignorant view of the world and his surroundings. He easily becomes judgemental and sometimes comes across as arrogant.

On the other hand, the film highlights Raina’s openness and friendly attitude, and she is able to make a connection with everyone around her, whether it be the elderly uncle, the young kid, or Udayan. Not forcing herself to be “modern” on the outside, Raina has been able to immerse herself in the surroundings, in all of the places she has travelled to, and become truly modern *inside*. She has a broader view of the world and the strength to go against the common trends and stereotypes, like the ones that Udayan has formed in his mind. You might have thought Raina would speak entirely in Hindi, but were surprised to find out she spoke English, plus more than 10 other languages!

Udayan’s curiosity and willingness to change is something we all can learn from. He learns that language of choice does not indicate intelligence or sophistication. And like for him, an open mind and a simple detour can open up a whole new universe for us that had previously escaped our sight. So let’s keep our eyes open, like Udayan, to new possibilities and distant horizons, and let’s defeat ignorance and arrogance, like Raina, with knowledge, wisdom, kindness, and an open mind.

So we need both – Raina and Udayan, no matter how different they might be. It is no coincidence that **raina means “night” and udayan means “day”** ☺️
